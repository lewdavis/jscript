<h1> Red lantern Lewgle is here</h1>
<p>My nickname is Lewgle, and I am a computer programming major.</p> <br>

<h2> My plan to improve my learning and time management </h2>
<p> I'm excited at the fact that school is now here! I think my biggest flaw is I get over-whelmed easily. So I've made it a point to see the small goals, and use those as a way to work harder towards becoming more successful. Hopefully, I'll adjust my learning style to be more well rounded, but since I'm a musician, it should be a fun challenge to learn better beyond just Aurally. </p>
<ol>
<li> I'm really excited to begin learning again due to being the first one in my family to pursue a degree. </li>
<li> It's great to challenge myself to learn in different ways. As a musician, I feel I am more easily ready to adapt to different learning styles.I've been a full-time musician since 2013 and prior to that have been a supervisor in retail, and a cook.</li>
<li> I came to BCC to have the freedom to learn, but also push myself in a major that I really feel can help every aspect of my life.</Li>
</ol>
My goals as a musician and as a person have led me to BCC. Here's a lot of the music I compose. <br>

<ul>
<li> My goals after BCC are to start my own buisness where I can help others organize their buisnesses and have my own doing instrument related repairs including pedal repairs, amp repairs, software mods, and so on. </li>
<li> I choose Computer Programming because I felt that it could helpw ith any future endevor I chose. </li>
<li> I'd like to become a better time organzier and sinch starting here, I've realized I'm going to need to have priorities, and windows based on how I perform and remember things. </Li>
